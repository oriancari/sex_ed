            <p id="text1">In spanish, malcojida is an insult men throw at women who act a bit feisty. The phrase directly translates to: badly fucked. I love it. It’s men who are doing the fucking wrong and yet, somehow, they to turned the phrase into an insult for us.

            Here’s a fun fact: at least 10% of women have confessed to never experiencing an orgasm. To make matters worse, scientists still don’t know what constitutes a female orgasm. If experts are clueless, how are we supposed to know? And then the cherry on top: the wage gap isn’t the only gap dividing men and women. The pleasure gap is real; studies show roughly 39% of women reach orgasm while having sex, as opposed to 91% of men. We’re ending this gap. If we’re not getting equal pay, we might as well get equal pleasure.  </p>
