You may be thinking: I’ve made it this far without exploring my sexuality. Why change my lifestyle now? Easy. 
Several studies, in particular, one written by Claudia Schmiedeberg, et al. titled “The More or the Better? How Sex Contributes to Life Satisfaction,” disclaim that an increase in sexual frequency directly translates to an increase in life satisfaction.  And why not increase your overall life satisfaction, even if by just a pinch? As my grandmother infamously says, a little sugar can go a long way. Sure, she’s referring to baking...whereas I’m talking about sticking dildos up your vagina. Oops, too soon?

<p id="text" class ="words">
	Schmiedeberg et al.’s paper points out two interesting details. In so far, academic literature has focused on 
analyzing the direct correlation between life satisfaction and relationship status, employment status, income, pro-social behavior, and optimal health. Yet little research has been done regarding how a successful sexual lifestyle can directly influence your happiness. And surprise, surprise, it does. A lot.

<p id="text" class ="words">
	Check this out. If you’re doubting whether or not Schmiedeberg et al.’s research study is legit, this is how they 
came to their conclusion. Throughout the course of five years, the researchers studied the life satisfaction of 5332 individuals. Damn. Now, that’s commitment.

<p id="text" class ="words">
	That being said, the study places a high emphasis on the fact that we all have very diverse sex drives. Which 
leads me to say: This webpage isn’t pushing you to indulge in your sexual desires on a daily basis, that won’t guarantee your happiness. Instead, this webpage is here to tell you that it’s impertinent you evaluate what your sex drive is, what your sexual desires are, and to guide you as to what steps you can take to satisfy that longing.
