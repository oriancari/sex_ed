Did you know that the clitoris is the only human organ whose sole purpose is to provide sexual pleasure? And despite this, women have still been shamed for masturbating. Or at least the stigma around female masturbation runs high. According to Lucy Beresford, therapist and host of London-based radio station LBC’s “Relationships & Sex Advice” show, the number one reason women choose not to masturbate is due to shame. And that shame is largely fueled by “Something in their past or in their upbringing that has led them to either view themselves as unworthy of sexual pleasure or that “good girls” don’t touch their bodies.” But Beresford incites women to fight against those feelings of shame and guilt and to indulge in their sexual desires.

Of course, women (an entire gender) can’t be generalized or fit into a single box. Guilt and shame aren’t the sole obstacles we face when exploring our sexuality. It pains me to state the reality that many women have suffered sexual abuse, myself included, which leads them to associate sex with anything other than pleasure. In these cases, masturbating doesn’t incite sexual pleasure but may provoke feelings of fear and repulsion.

<p id="text" class ="words">
That being said, for those who do indulge in solo play, what methods do they employ? Huh. If only there were a study done regarding the matter, such as… “Women's Experiences With Genital Touching, Sexual Pleasure, and Orgasm: Results From a U.S. Probability Sample of Women Ages 18 to 94,” written by Debby Herbenick, et al. Amazing study, which depicts the various styles of touch women practice when masturbating.

Now, let’s take a step back for a minute here. It’s important to point out that there is no wrong way of doing solo play. We’re all different, and whatever piques your interest, as long as it doesn’t include child pornography, is safe to explore. Yet, the main objective of this website is to guide you through that exploration, so let’s dive into the various styles of touch you can try out to finally reach the holy grail...the female orgasm.

	So, the study, “Women's Experiences With Genital Touching, Sexual Pleasure, and Orgasm,” focused on evaluating what roughly 1,000 women did to reach orgasm. The researchers too everything into account, from their age to their sexual orientation. Take a look at this kick-ass infographic I did of the study’s demographic:

	But what I loved about this study is respondents’ answers to the question: How frequently do you orgasm? 
</p>

<br>
<p id="text" class ="words">
The 90.4% of women, from said demographic who claimed to have orgasmed, were later asked what factors do they consider increase the chances of them cumming? In both sexual intercourse and solo play, that is. 
</p>
<img src="/Users/orideangelis/Desktop/ima capstone/resources/web/data/orgasmenhancement.png" style="width:100%">
<br>
<p id="text" class ="words">
	The women surveyed were asked about the styles of touch they employed during solo play, the location fo touch, and even the number of styles endorsed. Cause, with sexual pleasure you always have to keep it interesting. As it turns out, “greater sexual variety is associated with a higher likelihood of orgasm.” 
</p>

<br>
<p id="text" class ="words">
	And Finally, they were even asked the amount of pressure they employ during masturbation! Everything matters. Again, whatever tickles your fancy. 
</p>
<img src="/Users/orideangelis/Desktop/ima capstone/resources/web/data/styleoftouch.png" style="width:100%">

<p id="text" class ="words">
	So there you have it. What a small sample of 1000 women do daily to reach orgasm. Don’t be part of that 10% who’s never felt the surging feeling of cumming your brains out. There’s nothing wrong with masturbating. And much less if you’re a woman. Our clitoris is there for a reason, we should put it to work! Wouldn’t want it to disappear in generations to come like the appendix is rumored to.
