Did you know there’s a difference between clitorally stimulated orgasm and vaginally stimulated orgasms?  Because I had no clue before I started this project. And as it turns out, not only are these different, and incredibly so, but most women who employ clitoral stimulation to reach orgasm have greater control of their sexual arousal.

So, roughly 64% of the women surveyed by Nicole Prause, et al. for the study, “Clitorally Stimulated Orgasms Are Associated With Better Control of Sexual Desire, and Not Associated With Depression or Anxiety, Compared With Vaginally Stimulated Orgasms,” claim that they use either clitoral or vaginal stimulation to reach orgasm during sex. And the number of women who consider clitoral stimulation is necessary to reach orgasm is even higher. Out of a questionnaire sent out to 749 women, 94% assured that clitoral stimulation facilitates the orgasm experience.

Alright, but we’re looking at all these numbers, yet what does this mean? Let’s take a look at clitoral stimulation first. I’m guessing that, by the name, you have at least a vague idea of what this is. In rough terms, clitoral stimulation is when a woman (or her partner) plays with the clitoris during sex to be able to reach the holy grail.

	And maybe now you’re thinking: but the clitoris is part of the vagina, so what the hell is vaginal stimulation? It’s as if we were looking at vibrators or dildos. Vaginal stimulation is when you arouse a woman through the vaginal opening, in other words, the dildo. Studies show that women consider deep vaginal stimulation is most effective at helping them reach orgasm.

	Comment: I guess this is where the “size matters” myth comes from. Sure, during heterosexual intercourse size helps, but when men do their magic right, size is rarely a concern anymore.

Now that we’re all on the same page, let’s get back at it. As it turns out, most women need clitoral stimulation to reach orgasm when engaging in solo play. Vaginal stimulation sometimes just doesn’t cut it (Again, Debunking the “size matters” myth). But when it comes to making that need known to their partner, there seems to be a certain reluctance. Studies show that when a male partner is introduced, clitoral stimulation and orgasm frequency drop like flies. But then, women who claimed they kept stimulating their clitoris when having sex showed they were more orgasmic with their partners.

	So, here’s the key takeaway, in my opinion. Heterosexual women have got to stop worrying about their male partner’s ego. We have got to stop babysitting men. Not to mention, there shouldn’t be a reason as to why they would mind you playing with yourself during intercourse. If anything, you’re alleviating men from their duty to satisfy you on their own. Hello, group projects, anyone? Sometimes you just have to pick up the other person’s slack.
